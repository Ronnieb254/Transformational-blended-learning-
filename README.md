Blended learning is broadly defined as replacing seat time in courses with online activities to
 achieve learning objectives. Blended learning exists
 on a continuum with minimal online activities on one 
end and minimal face-to-face activities on the other
 end.  Most institutions do not prescribe a definition 
of blended learning and acknowledge that it has different
 meanings for different disciplines and can fall anywhere
 in the continuum.  When colleges and universities fail 
to define blended learning at an institutional level, however,
 it is then reduced to the broadest understanding and open
 to interpretation regarding the ratio of face-to-face time 
and online interaction and activities.  The absence of a precise 
definition undermines the important distinctions that blended 
learning is a transformational redesign of teaching and learning. 
 And the broad definition then lends itself to blended learning 
becoming a mere description of a singular course rather than an
 institutional strategyblended learning is "the thoughtful fusion
 of face-to-face and online learning experiences" such that
 the strengths of each mode are blended into an optimal learning 
experience.  At most institutions, a blended course is synonymous
 with a hybrid course.
